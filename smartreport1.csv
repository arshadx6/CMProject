,Test Name,Test Explanation,Oberved Value,Required Range,Explanation
0,Hemoglobin,"Hemoglobin is a protein contained within red RBCs that sends oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues. The hemoglobin test is useful in diagnosing anemia, with many practitioners preferring this test over the hematocrit test.",13.8,"[12.0, 15.0]",Your levels are fine.
1,RBC,"Red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen to tissues throughout the body, making them important to its healthy functioning. A red blood cell count estimates the volume of RBCs within an individual.",4.82,"[3.8, 4.8]","if the results show a count above or below normal levels this can indicate various medical conditions to a doctor. However, this form of testing is unable to pinpoint the root causes of any irregularities, meaning, if this is the case, further tests will be necessary."
2,HCT,Hematocrit is the percentage by volume of red cells in your blood.,42.9,"[40.0, 50.0]",Your levels are fine.
3,MCV,"The average volume of RBCs, or the space each red blood cell fills, is measured through this test. ",89.0,"[83.0, 101.0]",Your levels are fine.
4,MCH,"The lab tests the average amount of hemoglobin present in each red blood cell.

",28.6,"[27.0, 32.0]",Your levels are fine.
